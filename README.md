This repo checks TA-lib out from SVN and builds it with cmake, for better cross-platform compatibility.

By default, it will generate two assets:

    - ta_lib shared library
    - ta_regtest: regression tests

## Python
This library is also pip-installable, in case you want to use TA-lib but do not use conda.
